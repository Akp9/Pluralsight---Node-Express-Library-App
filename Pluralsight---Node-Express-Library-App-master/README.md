# Pluralsight - Node Express 'Library' App
_December 2015_

**From the course: _Building Web Applications with Node.js and Express 4.0_**

_By Jonathan Mills_

This is my sample 'Library' web application that I created as a part of following the above Pluralsight course. Great beginners course into Node.js and using open stack tools such as:
- Brackets IDE
- Bower (client-side package management)
- Gulp
etc

Each commit relates to a module from the course so you can follow along from any stage.
